# Collatz-Conjecture-Python

A simple program for Collatz Conjecture

### What is Collatz Conjecture? (aka the 3n+1 problem)

The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one. <br/>

Basically if the number is even it will multiply it by 3 and add 1 <br/>
If it is even, the number will be divided by 2
